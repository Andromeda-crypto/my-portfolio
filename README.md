my-portfolio

This is the codebase for my personal portfolio website, a space where I share a little about who I am, what I'm learning, and what I’ve been building along the way. I'm currently a computer science student, and this project is both a reflection of my skills and an expression of how I think about design, problem-solving, and growth in tech.

The site is built with pure HTML and CSS keeping it intentionally lightweight, responsive. I wanted something that felt both welcoming and personal while still being clean and structured. From the landing page to the individual sections like About, Projects, Skills, and Contact, every part is designed to give a quick but meaningful glimpse into my journey and interests.

I’ve added sections for highlighting projects, with GitHub links  and there’s a space to include technologies I’ve been working with, tools I’m comfortable in, and courses I’ve taken or am currently pursuing. As I grow and build more, I plan to keep updating this site to reflect that progress. It's not meant to be perfect, it's meant to be honest.

If you're someone curious about how this works under the hood, feel free to explore the code, fork it, or use parts of it as a starting point for your own ideas. And if you’re working on something interesting, hiring, or just want to chat — I’d love to connect.
